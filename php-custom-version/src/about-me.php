                <p>
                    <b>Who i am?</b><br>
                    I'm a 10 years experience Software Engineer & Full Stack Developer but I would like to tell you a little bit more about me.<br><br>

                    If I had to describe myself with a few words I would say logical, deep thinker and reliable. <br>
                    Since I was a kid, I have always been interested in all things related to Technology, Math or Science.<br>
                    This is why it was natural for me, to choose a technical type of high school with a "Computer Science" specialization.<br><br>


                    During the high school years, I developed my nerd personality approaching Physics, Maths and Informatics (and absolutely loved those subjects) but, thanks to amazing professors, I also discovered a deep interest in some of the human Sciences such as Poetry and Philosophy.<br>
                    That being said, you may understand why, back in 2008, I won both the Logic&Math games and the poetry festival held in my local town.<br>
                    I graduated in 2009 with the highest grade in the entire school (100 summa cum laude) and you can find me in the Italian National Register of Excellence - INDIRE.<br><br>


                    After high school, I started Computer Engineering at "Modena and Reggio Emilia University" in 2009 but I dropped out in 2011 because I was annoyed by finding out I had already studied and learned most of the lessonsâ€™ topics; On top of this, I simultaneously found a job as Software Engineer, which played a decisive role in dropping out of university.<br><br>

                    Iâ€™ve been working as a Full Stack Developer and Software Engineer for 10 years.<br>
                     All this time, I learned how to handle the entire engineering and developing process of a project.<br>
                    My Senior abilities include choosing the correct technologies and solutions to adopt, designing the database structure, engineering and designing the back-end and front-end part of the software, Testing & Optimizing the  Release phase.
                    <br><br>

                    During the COVID-19 pandemic I developed two NO-PROFIT and completerly free web applications to help consumers and companies to get in touch and informed.<br>
                    "NearMe" is a digital showcase where each local company can add some information about the services, opening hours and general info it operates during the pandemic closures.<br>
                    Moreover, I developed a dashboard with data provided by Italian Governament and Italian Civil Protection, on their GitHub public repository, about the pandemic progress in italy.<br>
                    Itâ€™s a simple and clear way to help people be daily updated.<br><br>


                    Being a Software Engineer makes me feel like a superhero, capable to create super powerful stuff that might even end up changing peopleâ€™s life.<br><br>

                    I like to read and study on my own; not only Physics, Math and science, Iâ€™m also interested in deepening some human Sciences like Philosophy, Social Psychology and Psychology.<br><br>

                    Currently, I'm studing at the Open Source Society University (OSSU) to go deeper in some theoretical aspects of Informatics and I'm approaching to the Open Source World.<br><br>

                Obviously, you can see the result yourself navigating into this website. <br>
                I've decided to create it since I wanted my own place to experiment, have my own digital portfolio/resume and get in touch with other developers. <br>
                I made the decision to develop this website completely from scratch (using PHP, Bootstrap, JQuery/Ajax, MySQL etc.), without WordPress, because I wanted to have it the most customizable, light and personal as possible. <br>
                In addition, it is a good training exercise for me, being able to continuously readjusting and updating it. <br>
                In the near future, I will add a custom blog to get in touch and help some other developer with my experience.
